# spire-satellite-inter-antenna-bias
Inter-antenna (POD/RO) bias estimates for Spire LEMUR (currently 2023 only).

The file spire_ro_pod_bias_estimates_v0002.h5 contains the daily average biases and standard deviations (computed from raw arc-based bias estimates) in HDF5 format.
Estimates between each RO antenna and the POD antenna are provided.  The RO1/RO2 labels correspond to FRO/BRO or vice versa, as described in the paper.
